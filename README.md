## Introduction
Since my son is a huge fan of BMW, we created a small project:
* Buy a used passanger seat
* Create a small logic to allow him to enable e. g. seat heater, temperature indicator, and maybe some other equipment
* Screw the seat on a wooden plate and use it as furniture
This Readme shall guide you through the process in case you plan something similar.

### Part numbers
Before we rework the seat, let us summarize the different part numbers of the seat and its sub-components:
- Vehicle: BMW F10
- Airbag: 307130710-AD
- Head support: ks726381711
- Seat ECU: BMW 921646801
- Wiring harness: 9 259 205
- Connector: BMW 91676881

## Rework
As a first step, please use a professional service to remove the airbag from the seat. Please note that there might be legal constraints to do that without professional service.
You should also disconnect the connector from the head support to the ECU below the seat to avoid any kind of emergency action.
